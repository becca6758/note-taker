 # <Note-Taker>

## Description

Note Taker is an application that allows the user to create, take, and deletes notes. This application was created so it could assist users in taking and finding their notes on their computer or their mobile device without having to look for a pen and paper when there is a sudden situation that calls for  note to be needed. Through this project I was able to apply what I learned about Express.js, routing methods, and how to upload sites to Heroku.
